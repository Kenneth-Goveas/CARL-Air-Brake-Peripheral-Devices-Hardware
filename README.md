# CARL Air Brake Peripheral Devices Hardware

This repository contains the electronic hardware design for the peripheral
devices module of the [CARL Air Brake][cab-repo] computer. The CARL Air Brake
computer automatically controls a rocket air brake in flight, so that the
vehicle attains an apogee at the desired altitude. Its peripheral devices module
contains the necessary sensors and the brake actuator.
